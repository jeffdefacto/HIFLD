Address ranges provide a way of locating homes and businesses based on their street addresses when no other location information is available. Using a house number, street name, street side and ZIP code, address ranges can locate the address to the geographic area associated to that side of the street. Once geocoded, the U.S. Census Bureau can assign the address to a field assignment area or tabulate the data for that address. In addition, academics, researchers, professionals and government agencies outside of the Census Bureau use MAF/TIGER address ranges to transform tabular addresses into geographical datasets for decision-making and analytical purposes. Address ranges must be unique to geocode addresses to the correct location and avoid geocoding conflicts. Multiple elements in MAF/TIGER are required to make an address range unique including street names, address house numbers and street feature geometries, such as street centerlines. The address range data model is designed to maximize geocoding matches with their correct geographic areas in MAF/TIGER by allowing an unlimited number of address range-to-street feature relationships. The Census Bureau’s Geography Division devises numerous operations and processes to build and maintain high quality address ranges so that: Address ranges accurately describe the location of addresses on the ground. Address All possible city-style addresses are geocoded. Address ranges can handle all known address and street name variations. Address ranges conform with current U.S. Postal Service ZIP codes. Address ranges are reliable and free from conflicts. Automated software continually updates existing address ranges, builds new address ranges and corrects errors. An automated operation links address location points and tabular address information to street feature edges with matching street names in the same block to build and modify address ranges. Many business rules and legal value checks ensure quality address range data in MAF/TIGER. For example, business rules prevent adding or modifying address ranges that overlap another house number range with the same street name and ZIP code. Legal value checks verify that address ranges include mandatory attribute information, valid data types and valid character values. Some of the TIGER/Line products for the public include address ranges and give the public the ability to geocode addresses to MAF/TIGER address ranges for the user’s own purpose. The address range files are available for the nation, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Island Areas at the county level. TIGER/Line files require geographic information system (GIS) software to use. The Census Bureau Geocoder Service is a web service provided to the public. The service accepts up to 1,000 input addresses and, based on Census address ranges, returns the interpolated geocoded location and census geographies. Users can access the service a web interface or a representational state transfer (REST) application program interface (API) web service.

DoD installations are commonly referred to as a base, camp, post, station, yard, center, homeport facility for any ship, or other activity under the jurisdiction, custody, control of the DoD. While every attempt has been made to provide the best available data quality, this data set is intended for use at mapping scales between 1:50,000 and 1:3,000,000. For this reason, boundaries in this data set may not perfectly align with DoD site boundaries depicted in other federal data sources. Maps produced at a scale of 1:50,000 or smaller which otherwise comply with National Map Accuracy Standards, will remain compliant when this data is incorporated. Boundary data is most suitable for larger scale maps; point locations are better suited for mapping scales between 1:250,000 and 1:3,000,000. If a site is part of a Joint Base (effective/designated on 1 October, 2010) as established under the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure process, it is attributed with the name of the Joint Base. All sites comprising a Joint Base are also attributed to the responsible DoD Component, which is not necessarily the pre-2005 Component responsible for the site.","intelligenceMilitary,DoD,MIRTA,HIFLD,Feature Service,SDI,NSDI,Open Data,FGDC,Emergency Preparedness,Disaster Planning,Infrastructure","This geospatial dataset contains the authoritative point locations and (where available) boundaries of Department of Defense sites, commonly referred to as installations, ranges, training areas, bases, forts, camps, armories, centers, etc. These installations are, in many cases, comprised of a number of subordinate sites.

The Service broadcasts correction signals on marine radiobeacon frequencies to improve the accuracy and integrity to GPS-derived positions. The Coast Guard DGPS Service provides 10-meter accuracy in all established coverage areas. Typically, the position error of a DGPS position is 1 to 3 meters, greatly enhancing harbor entrance and approach navigation. The System provides service for coastal coverage of the continental U.S., the Great Lakes, Puerto Rico, portions of Alaska, Hawaii, and a large part of the Mississippi River Basin. Many foreign nations are implementing standard DGPS services modeled after the U.S. Coast Guard?s system to improve maritime safety in their critical waterways. The Coast Guard's maritime Differential Global Positioning Service achieved Full Operational Capability (FOC) on 15 March 1999 as announced in the DOT press release. The maritime DGPS service provides 10 meter (2 dRMS) navigation accuracy, integrity alarms for GPS and DGPS out-of-tolerance conditions within 10 seconds of detection, availability of 99.7% per month, coastal coverage to the continental United States, the Great Lakes, Puerto Rico/US Virgin Islands, and selected portions of Alaska and Hawaii. The achievement of FOC culminates a six-year effort to convert existing radiobeacon sites and construct new sites to transmit DGPS corrections. Several equipment upgrades were installed to improve system performance. During the procurement and installation phases of the system upgrades, the maritime DGPS service operated under Initial Operational Capability rules, where the signals provided accurate corrections with integrity to the maximum extent possible.","Differential GPS,USCG,GPS,USCG Differential GPS,HIFLD Open,HIFLD,USGS,Feature Service,SDI,NSDI,Open Data,FGDC,Emergency Preparedness,Disaster Planning,Infrastructure",This dataset was created for incorporation into the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) 2008 Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP) Gold data inventory release to the Federal Interagency Homeland Security and Homeland Defense (HLS/HD) Community.,"/Categories/Disasters and Natural Hazards,/Categories/GeoPlatform.gov/HIFLD",,None (Public Use),en-us,https://services1.arcgis.com/Hp6G80Pky0om7QvQ/arcgis/rest/services/US_Coast_Guard_USCG_Maritime_Differential_GPS_DGPS_Locations/FeatureServer,public,custom,USCG,"-173.08349418999333,3.328776797118824,-47.89418169000138,75.32815423240804",,US_Coast_Guard_USCG_Maritime_Differential_GPS_DGPS_Locations.geojson

(Excerpted from the National Incident Management System) The GFI source for this layer contains State and Federal Emergency Operations Centers in addition to local Emergency Operations Centers. This dataset contains these features as well. In cases where an Emergency Operations Center has a mobile unit, TechniGraphics captured the location of the mobile unit as a separate record. This record represents where the mobile unit is stored. If this location could not be verified, a point was placed in the approximate center of the Emergency Operations Centers service area. Effort was made by TechniGraphics to verify whether or not each Emergency Operations Center has a generator on-site and whether or not the Emergency Operations Center is located in a basement. This information is indicated by the values in the [GENERATOR] and [BASEMENT] fields respectively. In cases where more than one record existed for a geographical area (e.g., county, city), TechniGraphics verified whether or not one of the records represented an alternate location. This was indicated by appending ""-ALTERNATE"" to the value in the [NAME] field. Some Emergency Operations Centers are located at private residences. The [TYPE] field was manually evaluated during the delivery process to compare the records in which the [NAME] field contained ""-ALTERNATE"". In cases where these values contradicted information that was verified by TechniGraphics (e.g. [NAME] contained ""-ALTERNATE"" and [TYPE] = ""PRIMARY""), the value in the [TYPE] field was changed to match the type indicated by the [NAME] of the verified record. TechniGraphics did not change values in this field if the type was not verified. Records with ""-DOD"" appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries.

The outer limit of each of these zones is measured from the U.S. normal baseline, which coincides with the low water line depicted on NOAA charts and includes closing lines across the entrances of legal bays and rivers, consistent with international law. The U.S. baseline and associated maritime limits are reviewed and approved through the interagency U.S. Baseline Committee, which is chaired by the U.S. Department of State. The Committee serves the function of gaining interagency consensus on the proper location of the baseline using the provisions of the 1958 Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, to ensure that the seaward extent of U.S. maritime zones do not exceed the breadth that is permitted by international law. In 2002 and in response to mounting requests for digital maritime zones, NOAA launched a project to re-evaluate the U.S. baseline in partnership with other federal agencies via the U.S. Baseline Committee. The focus of the baseline evaluation was NOAA's largest scale, most recent edition nautical charts as well as supplemental source materials for verification of certain charted features. This dataset is a result of the 2002-present initiative and reflects a multi-year iterative project whereby the baseline and associated maritime limits were re-evaluated on a state or regional basis.

However, our current ability to understand landslide hazards at the national scale is limited, in part because spatial data on landslide occurrence across the U.S. varies greatly in quality, accessibility, and extent. Landslide inventories are typically collected and maintained by different agencies and institutions, usually within specific jurisdictional boundaries, and often with varied objectives and information attributes or even in disparate formats. The purpose of this data release is to provide an openly accessible, centralized map of existing information about landslide occurrence across the entire U.S. This data release is an update of previous versions 1 (Jones and others, 2019) and 2 (Belair and others, 2022). Changes relative to version 2 are summarized in us_ls_v3_changes.txt. It provides an integrated database of the landslides from these inventories (refer to US_Landslide_v3_gpkg) with a selection of uniform attributes, including links to the original digital inventory files (whenever available) (“Inv_URL”). The data release includes digital inventories created by both USGS and non-USGS authors. The original inventory is denoted by an abbreviation in the “Inventory” attribute. The full citation for each abbreviation can be found in us_ls_v3_references.csv. The date of the landslide event is included as a minimum and maximum (“Date_Min” and “Date_Max”) to accommodate events that happen within a range of dates. The date value is inherently difficult to interpret or discern due to the nature of landsliding, where some landslides move for long periods of time or move intermittently, and some areas can exhibit multiple landslide events. To preserve the constituent inventories as much as possible, we include all entries even if they are not considered landslides, such as “gullies” or “avalanche chutes.” We include a landslide type attribute when that information is available (“LS_Type”). The landslide classification system used in the original inventories is not always known or stated in the metadata, but many mapping entities use the schema from Cruden and Varnes (1996) or the updated schema from Hungr and others (2014). Given the wide range of landslide information sources in this data compilation, we provide an attribute to assess the relative confidence in the characterization of the location and extent of each landslide (entry) (“Confidence”). The confidence level reflects the resolution and quality of input data, as well as the method used for identification and mapping. This confidence does not reflect a formal accuracy assessment of field attributes. Relative to the previous data releases (version 1 and 2), this update (v3) includes more inventories, updated confidence rules, a new landslide type attribute, a new unique identifier (“USGS_ID”), new machine-readable date fields, and an ancillary database containing all fields from the original inventories (refer to US_Landslide_v3_ancillary).

The Bureau of Indian Affairs maintains a list of all federally recognized tribal governments and makes final determination of the inventory federal AIRs. The Census Bureau recognizes federal reservations (and associated off-reservation trust lands) as territory over which American Indian tribes have primary governmental authority. American Indian reservations can be legally described as colonies, communities, Indian colonies, Indian communities, Indian rancheria, Indian reservations, Indian villages, pueblos, rancherias, ranches, reservations, reserves, settlements, or villages. The Census Bureau contacts representatives of American Indian tribal governments to identify the boundaries for federal reservations through its annual Boundary and Annexation Survey. Federal reservations may cross state and all other area boundaries. State (state AIRs) are reservations established by some state governments for tribes recognized by the state. A governor-appointed state liaison provides the names and boundaries for state-recognized American Indian reservations to the Census Bureau. State reservations must be defined within a single state, but may cross county and other types of boundaries. To further identify and differentiate state-recognized American Indian areas from those that are federally recognized, the text, ""(state)"" is appended to the AIR name. Off-Reservation Trust Lands are areas for which the United States holds title in trust for the benefit of a tribe (tribal trust land) or for an individual American Indian (individual trust land). Trust lands can be alienated or encumbered only by the owner with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior or his/her authorized representative. Trust lands may be located on or off a reservation; however, the Census Bureau tabulates data only for off-reservation trust lands with the off-reservation trust lands always associated with a specific federally recognized reservation and/or tribal government. As for federally recognized reservations, the Census Bureau obtains the boundaries of off-reservation trust lands from American Indian tribal governments through its annual Boundary and Annexation Survey. The Census Bureau recognizes and tabulates data for reservations and off-reservation trust lands because American Indian tribes have primary governmental authority over these lands. The Census Bureau does not identify fee land (or land in fee simple status) or restricted fee lands as specific geographic areas.

Locating hazardous wrecks and obstructions is part of the ongoing NOAA charting process. The exact position of many wrecks is difficult to determine because of changes in the environment, varied survey methods, and human error. Some wrecks are intentionally placed in the ocean to serve as artificial reefs or for disposal. Others pose a health and environmental threat from their cargo. Ownership and control over wrecks and obstructions is governed by a collection of state and federal regulations, the Abandoned Shipwreck Act, National Historic Preservation Act, and National Marine Sanctuaries Act.

These data are a synthesis of two sources—the NOAA Office of Coast Survey’s 2016 Automated Wreck and Obstruction Information System (AWOIS), and NOAA Electronic Navigational Charts (ENC).

Paleoseismology combines well-established geologic practices such as trenching with archeological-style analysis to determine the time and magnitude of ancient earthquakes.

Early data gathering for the NID was led by USACE, which published the first inventory in 1975. By 1982, the NID included 68,153 dam records gathered from dam inspections, extensive record searches, and some feature extraction from aerial imagery. These NID databases were available on diskettes and compact discs. In the late 1990s, the NID was transitioned to a web-based platform and viewing the data on a map. Gathering data on dams also transitioned during this time - the most accurate data was now coming from states, territories, and federal agencies. This transition aligned with the establishment of the National Dam Safety Program. Information Available in the NID Since transitioning to a web-based platform, site visitors have been able to download or export certain data. The NID is currently the only place to find and download national data at such a detailed level. Today, the database contains information for more than 91,000 dams that meet the following criteria: Dams where a failure or mis-operation will likely result in loss of human life (high hazard potential). Dams where a failure or mis-operation would likely result in disruption of access to critical facilities, damage to public and private facilities, and require difficult mitigation efforts (significant hazard potential). Dams that meet minimum height and reservoir size requirements, even though they do not pose the same level of life or economic risk as those above – these dams are equal to or exceed 25 feet in height and exceed 15 acre-feet in storage, or equal to or exceeding 50 acre-feet in storage and exceeding 6 feet in height. The NID does not yet contain all dams in the U.S. that meet these criteria. Continued, routine updates to the NID and enhanced data collection efforts, focused on the most reliable data sources (primarily the many federal and state government dam regulatory programs), will help capture these dams and result in a more robust dataset over time.

The Census Bureau obtains school district boundaries, names, local education agency codes, grade ranges, and school district levels annually from state education officials. The Census Bureau collects this information for the primary purpose of providing the U.S. Department of Education with annual estimates of the number of children aged 5 through 17 in families in poverty within each school district, county, and state. This information serves as the basis for the Department of Education to determine the annual allocation of Title I funding to states and school districts The Census Bureau tabulates data for four types of school districts: elementary, secondary, unified, and administrative. Each school district is assigned a five-digit code that is unique within state. School district codes are the local education agency number assigned by the Department of Education and are not necessarily in alphabetical order by school district name. Unified school districts provide education to children of all school ages. In general, if there is a unified school district, no elementary or secondary school district exists. If there is an elementary school district, the secondary school district may or may not exist. Administrative school districts were added in 2022 and provide administrative, planning, and educational services for all grade ranges. Currently, the Census Bureau maintains administrative school districts only in Vermont, and they represent supervisory unions and supervisory districts. The Census Bureau categorizes school districts based on the grade ranges for which the school district is financially responsible. These may or may not be the same as the grade ranges that a school district operates. A typical example would be a school district that operates schools for children in grades Kindergarten (KG)-8 and pays a neighboring school district to educate children in grades 9-12. The first school district is operationally responsible for grades KG-8, but financially responsible for grades KG-12. Therefore, the Census Bureau would define the grade range for that school district as KG-12. If an elementary school district is financially responsible for grades KG-12 or Pre-Kindergarten (PK)-12, there will be no secondary school district represented for that area. In cases, where an elementary school district is financially responsible for only lower grades, there is generally a secondary school district that is financially responsible for providing educational services for the upper grades.

They include census county divisions, census subareas, minor civil divisions, and unorganized territories, and can be classified as either legal or statistical. Legal entities are termed minor civil divisions and statistical entities can be either census county divisions, census subareas, or unorganized territories. Minor Civil Divisions (MCDs) are the primary governmental or administrative divisions of a county in many states (parishes in Louisiana) and of the county equivalents in Puerto Rico and the Island Areas. MCDs in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas represent many different kinds of legal entities with a wide variety of governmental and/or administrative functions. MCDs include areas variously designated as barrios, barrios-pueblo, boroughs, charter townships, commissioner districts, election districts, election precincts, gores, grants, locations, magisterial districts, parish governing authority districts, plantations, purchases, reservations, supervisor's districts, towns, and townships. The Census Bureau recognizes MCDs in 29 states, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. The District of Columbia has no primary divisions, and is considered equivalent to an MCD for statistical purposes. In some states, all or some incorporated places are not part of any MCD; these places are termed independent places. In nine states-Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and Wisconsin-all incorporated places are independent places. In other states, incorporated places are part of, or dependent within, the MCDs in which they are located, or the pattern is mixed-some incorporated places are independent of MCDs and others are included within one or more MCDs. In New York and Maine, American Indian reservations (AIRs) generally exist outside the jurisdiction of any town (MCD) and thus also serve as the equivalent of MCDs for purposes of data presentation. In states with legal MCDs, the Census Bureau assigns a default FIPS county subdivision code of 00000 and ANSI code of eight zeroes in some coastal, territorial sea, and Great Lakes water where county subdivisions do not extend into the Great Lakes or out to the three-mile limit. Census County Divisions (CCDs) are areas delineated by the Census Bureau in cooperation with state, tribal, and local officials for statistical purposes. CCDs have no legal function and are not governmental units. CCD boundaries usually follow visible features and usually coincide with census tract boundaries. The name of each CCD is based on a place, county, or well-known local name that identifies its location. Census Subareas are statistical subdivisions of boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and census areas, the statistical equivalent entities for counties in Alaska. The state of Alaska and the Census Bureau cooperatively delineate the census subareas to serve as the statistical equivalents of MCDs. Unorganized Territories (UTs) are defined by the Census Bureau in nine MCD states where portions of counties or equivalent entities are not included in any legally established MCD or incorporated place. The Census Bureau recognizes such separate pieces of territory as one or more separate county subdivisions for census purposes. It assigns each unorganized territory a descriptive name, followed by the designation ""UT"".

The Census Bureau obtains school district boundaries, names, local education agency codes, grade ranges, and school district levels annually from state education officials. The Census Bureau collects this information for the primary purpose of providing the U.S. Department of Education with annual estimates of the number of children aged 5 through 17 in families in poverty within each school district, county, and state. This information serves as the basis for the Department of Education to determine the annual allocation of Title I funding to states and school districts The Census Bureau tabulates data for four types of school districts: elementary, secondary, unified, and administrative. Each school district is assigned a five-digit code that is unique within state. School district codes are the local education agency number assigned by the Department of Education and are not necessarily in alphabetical order by school district name. Unified school districts provide education to children of all school ages. In general, if there is a unified school district, no elementary or secondary school district exists. If there is an elementary school district, the secondary school district may or may not exist. Administrative school districts were added in 2022 and provide administrative, planning, and educational services for all grade ranges. Currently, the Census Bureau maintains administrative school districts only in Vermont, and they represent supervisory unions and supervisory districts. The Census Bureau categorizes school districts based on the grade ranges for which the school district is financially responsible. These may or may not be the same as the grade ranges that a school district operates. A typical example would be a school district that operates schools for children in grades Kindergarten (KG)-8 and pays a neighboring school district to educate children in grades 9-12. The first school district is operationally responsible for grades KG-8, but financially responsible for grades KG-12. Therefore, the Census Bureau would define the grade range for that school district as KG-12. If an elementary school district is financially responsible for grades KG-12 or Pre-Kindergarten (PK)-12, there will be no secondary school district represented for that area. In cases, where an elementary school district is financially responsible for only lower grades, there is generally a secondary school district that is financially responsible for providing educational services for the upper grades.

For example, blocks 3001, 3002, 3003 . . . 3999 in census tract 1210.02 belong to BG 3 in that census tract. Block groups generally contain between 600 and 3,000 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where a local or tribal government declined to participate and a regional organization or State Data Center was not available to participate. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries but may cross the boundaries of areas any other geographic entity. Tribal census tracts and tribal BGs are separate and unique geographic areas defined within federally recognized American Indian reservations and can cross state and county boundaries.

The Census Bureau delineates census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where state, local, or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of statistical data. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people with an optimum size of 4,000 people. A census tract usually covers a contiguous area; however the spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over a long time so that statistical comparisons can be made from census to census. Census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or merged as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow non-visible legal boundaries, such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some states and situations, to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. Tribal census tracts are a unique geographic entity defined within federally recognized American Indian reservations and can cross state and county boundaries. Tribal census tracts may be completely different from the census tracts and block groups defined by state and county.

These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. CDPs must be contained within a single state and may not extend into an incorporated place. There are no population size requirements for CDPs. Hawaii is the only state that has no incorporated places recognized by the Census Bureau. All places shown in decennial census data products for Hawaii are CDPs. By agreement with the State of Hawaii, the Census Bureau does not show data separately for the city of Honolulu, which is coextensive with Honolulu County. In Puerto Rico, which also does not have incorporated places, the Census Bureau recognizes only CDPs and refers to them as comunidades or zonas urbanas. Guam also has only CDPs.

The Census Bureau obtains school district boundaries, names, local education agency codes, grade ranges, and school district levels annually from state education officials. The Census Bureau collects this information for the primary purpose of providing the U.S. Department of Education with annual estimates of the number of children aged 5 through 17 in families in poverty within each school district, county, and state. This information serves as the basis for the Department of Education to determine the annual allocation of Title I funding to states and school districts The Census Bureau tabulates data for four types of school districts: elementary, secondary, unified, and administrative. Each school district is assigned a five-digit code that is unique within state. School district codes are the local education agency number assigned by the Department of Education and are not necessarily in alphabetical order by school district name. Unified school districts provide education to children of all school ages. In general, if there is a unified school district, no elementary or secondary school district exists. If there is an elementary school district, the secondary school district may or may not exist. Administrative school districts were added in 2022 and provide administrative, planning, and educational services for all grade ranges. Currently, the Census Bureau maintains administrative school districts only in Vermont, and they represent supervisory unions and supervisory districts. The Census Bureau categorizes school districts based on the grade ranges for which the school district is financially responsible. These may or may not be the same as the grade ranges that a school district operates. A typical example would be a school district that operates schools for children in grades Kindergarten (KG)-8 and pays a neighboring school district to educate children in grades 9-12. The first school district is operationally responsible for grades KG-8, but financially responsible for grades KG-12. Therefore, the Census Bureau would define the grade range for that school district as KG-12. If an elementary school district is financially responsible for grades KG-12 or Pre-Kindergarten (PK)-12, there will be no secondary school district represented for that area. In cases, where an elementary school district is financially responsible for only lower grades, there is generally a secondary school district that is financially responsible for providing educational services for the upper grades.

The highly adaptable and effective system of barge navigation moves over 625 million tons of commodities annually, which includes coal, petroleum products, various other raw materials, food and farm products, chemicals, and manufactured goods. The shallow draft waterways have many unique characteristics and difficulties over coastal harbor and ocean navigation; river levels can change by over 30 feet in a seasonal cycle, the navigation channel can shift significantly within the river banks, and shifting yet ever present river currents pose constant challenges in these confined waterways. Electronic chart systems can offer significant benefits to vessels including accurate and real-time display of vessel position relative to waterway features, voyage planning and monitoring, training tools for new personnel and integrated display of river charts, radar, and Automatic Identification Systems. Following recommendations by the National Transportation Safety Board, the National Academy of Science and the American Waterways Operators, Congress directed the Corps of Engineers to develop and publish electronic charts for the inland waterways. Development of Inland Electronic Navigational Charts (IENCs) to cover the Mississippi River and tributaries thus began in 2001 with pilot projects on the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana and Lower Mississippi River near Vicksburg, Mississippi. These projects, which involved a combination of in-house and contract activities, were the first efforts to collect and convert inland waterway data, commonly used for river and channel maintenance, into the international S-57 hydrographic data exchange.

The Census Bureau obtains school district boundaries, names, local education agency codes, grade ranges, and school district levels annually from state education officials. The Census Bureau collects this information for the primary purpose of providing the U.S. Department of Education with annual estimates of the number of children aged 5 through 17 in families in poverty within each school district, county, and state. This information serves as the basis for the Department of Education to determine the annual allocation of Title I funding to states and school districts The Census Bureau tabulates data for four types of school districts: elementary, secondary, unified, and administrative. Each school district is assigned a five-digit code that is unique within state. School district codes are the local education agency number assigned by the Department of Education and are not necessarily in alphabetical order by school district name. Unified school districts provide education to children of all school ages. In general, if there is a unified school district, no elementary or secondary school district exists. If there is an elementary school district, the secondary school district may or may not exist. Administrative school districts were added in 2022 and provide administrative, planning, and educational services for all grade ranges. Currently, the Census Bureau maintains administrative school districts only in Vermont, and they represent supervisory unions and supervisory districts. The Census Bureau categorizes school districts based on the grade ranges for which the school district is financially responsible. These may or may not be the same as the grade ranges that a school district operates. A typical example would be a school district that operates schools for children in grades Kindergarten (KG)-8 and pays a neighboring school district to educate children in grades 9-12. The first school district is operationally responsible for grades KG-8, but financially responsible for grades KG-12. Therefore, the Census Bureau would define the grade range for that school district as KG-12. If an elementary school district is financially responsible for grades KG-12 or Pre-Kindergarten (PK)-12, there will be no secondary school district represented for that area. In cases, where an elementary school district is financially responsible for only lower grades, there is generally a secondary school district that is financially responsible for providing educational services for the upper grades.

Watershed boundaries are determined solely upon science-based hydrologic principles, not favoring any administrative boundaries or special projects, nor particular program or agency. This dataset represents the hydrologic unit boundaries to the 12-digit for the entire United States. Some areas may also include additional subdivisions representing the 14- and 16-digit hydrologic unit (HU). At a minimum, the HUs are delineated at 1:24,000-scale in the conterminous United States, 1:25,000-scale in Hawaii, Pacific basin and the Caribbean, and 1:63,360-scale in Alaska, meeting the National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). Higher resolution boundaries were developed where partners and data existed and were incorporated back into the WBD. WBD data are delivered as a dataset of polygons and corresponding lines that define the boundary of the polygon. WBD polygon attributes include hydrologic unit codes (HUC), size (in the form of acres and square kilometers), name, downstream hydrologic unit code, type of watershed, non-contributing areas, and flow modifications. The HUC describes where the unit is in the country and the level of the unit.

Data are provided as netCDF and as gzipped comma-separated-values (CSV). Background Information In the 1980s, NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) developed deep ocean tsunameters for the early detection, measurement, and real-time reporting of tsunamis in the open ocean. The PMEL's Project Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART®) developed the tsunameters. A DART® system consists of a seafloor bottom pressure recorder (BPR) capable of detecting tsunamis as small as 1 centimeter, and a moored surface buoy for real-time communications. In 2003, operational responsibility of DART® transitioned from PMEL to the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC). There are currently 39 U.S. owned and operated DART® buoys installed throughout the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. This completes the current requirements for the DART® array. NOAA has installed DART® systems in the Indian Ocean in partnership with several international organizations (Owned Operated DART Buoys Data Available at NDBC).

It should not include planned and suspended (non-operational) sites and mobile clinics. These definitions were set by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Policy Board in December 1998 and are the basis for defining the category and the additional service types for each VHA service site. These definitions cover sites generally owned by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) with the exception of leased and contracted community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs). 1. VA HOSPITAL: an institution (health care site) that is owned, staffed and operated by VA and whose primary function is to provide inpatient services. NOTE: Each geographically unique inpatient division of an integrated facility is counted as a separate hospital. 2. VA RESIDENTIAL REHABILITATION TREATMENT PROGRAM (RRTP): provides comprehensive health and social services in a VA facility for eligible veterans who are ambulatory and do not require the level of care provided in nursing homes. 3. VA NURSING HOME CARE UNITS (NHCU): provides care to individuals who are not in need of hospital care, but who require nursing care and related medical or psychosocial services in an institutional setting. VA NHCUs are facilities designed to care for patients who require a comprehensive care management system coordinated by an interdisciplinary team. Services provided include nursing, medical, rehabilitative, recreational, dietetic, psychosocial, pharmaceutical, radiological, laboratory, dental and spiritual. 4. VA OUTPATIENT CLINICS: a. Community-Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC): a VA-operated, VA-funded, or VA-reimbursed health care facility or site geographically distinct or separate from a parent medical facility. This term encompasses all types of VA outpatient clinics, except hospital-based, independent and mobile clinics. Satellite, community-based, and outreach clinics have been redefined as CBOCs. Technically, CBOCs fall into four Categories, which are: > (i) VA-owned. A CBOC that is owned and staffed by VA. > (ii) Leased. A CBOC where the space is leased (contracted), but is staffed by VA. NOTE: This includes donated space staffed by VA. > (iii) Contracted. A CBOC where the space and the staff are not VA. This is typically a Healthcare Management Organization (HMO)-type provided where multiple sites can be associated with a single station identifier. > (iv) Not Operational. A CBOC which has been approved by Congress, but has not yet begun operating. b. Hospital-Based Outpatient Clinic: outpatient clinic functions located at a hospital. c. Independent Outpatient Clinic: a full-time, self-contained, freestanding, ambulatory care clinic that has no management, program, or fiscal relationship to a VA medical facility. Primary and specialty health care services are provided in an outpatient setting. 5. VET CENTER: Provides professional readjustment counseling, community education, outreach to special populations, brokering of services with community agencies, and access to links between the veteran and VA. 6. VA MEDICAL CENTER (VAMC): a medical center is a unique VA site of care providing two or more types of services that reside at a single physical site location. The services provided are the primary service as tracked in the VHA Site Tracking (VAST) (i.e., VA Hospital, Nursing Home, Domiciliary, independent outpatient clinic (IOC), hospital-based outpatient clinic (HBOC), and CBOC). The definition of VA medical center does not include the Vet Centers as an identifying service. This dataset is based upon GFI data received from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).

The National Map Gazetteer contains information about physical and cultural geographic features, geographic areas, and locational entities that are generally recognizable and locatable by name (have achieved some landmark status) and are of interest to any level of government or to the public for any purpose that would lead to the representation of the feature in printed or electronic maps and/or geographic information systems. The dataset includes features of all types in the United States, its associated areas, and Antarctica, current and historical, but not including roads and highways. The dataset holds the federally recognized name of each feature and defines the feature location by state, county, USGS topographic map, and geographic coordinates. Other attributes include names or spellings other than the official name, feature classification, and historical and descriptive information. The dataset assigns a unique, permanent feature identifier, the Feature ID, as a standard Federal key for accessing, integrating, or reconciling feature data from multiple data sets. This dataset is a flat model, establishing no relationships between features, such as hierarchical, spatial, jurisdictional, organizational, administrative, or in any other manner. As an integral part of The National Map, the Gazetteer collects data from a broad program of partnerships with federal, state, and local government agencies and other authorized contributors. The Gazetteer provides data to all levels of government and to the public, as well as to numerous applications through a web query site, web map, feature and XML services, file download services, and customized files upon request. The National Map download client allows free downloads of public domain geographic names data by state in a pipe-delimited text format. For additional information on the GNIS, go to https://www.usgs.gov/tools/geographic-names-information-system-gnis.

The chart images are rendered from the latest NOAA electronic navigational chart (NOAA ENC®) data. The ENC data and the chart images derived from it are updated weekly. Each display service portrays the ENC data with a different symbology set.

The ECDIS Display Service uses symbology developed by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) for the display of ENC data on Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems (ECDIS) that large ocean- going vessels and many smaller commercial ships use for navigation.

The GIS data and services are designed to provide the user with the ability to determine the flood zone, base flood elevation, and floodway status for a particular location. It also has information about the NFIP communities, map panels, cross sections, hydraulic structures, Coastal Barrier Resource System, and base maps such as road, stream, and public land survey data. Through flood studies, FEMA produces Flood Insurance Study Reports, FIRM Panels, and FIRM Databases. FIRM Databases that become effective are incorporated into the NFHL. Updates to the NFHL are issued through Letters of Map Revision (LOMRs) and Letters of Map Amendment (LOMAs). Continuously updated, the NFHL serves as a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map representing the current effective flood data for those communities where maps have been digitized. NFHL data can be viewed with widely available GIS software, including freely available programs that work with GIS shapefiles. For more information on the NFHL, see the online resources referenced herein. Using base maps: The minimum horizontal positional accuracy for base map hydrographic and transportation features used with the NFHL is the NSSDA radial accuracy of 38 feet. Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) point locations are approximate. The location of the LOMA is referenced in the legal description of the letter itself. LOMA points can be viewed in the NFHL Interactive Map on the FEMA GeoPlatform.","nfhl,nfip,flood,risk,fema,National Flood Hazard",The National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL) is a compilation of GIS data that comprises a nationwide digital Flood Insurance Rate Map.,,Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA),,en-us,https://hazards.fema.gov/arcgis/rest/services/public/NFHL/MapServer,public,,GeoPlatform ArcGIS Online,"-176.5991191899889,13.265230126269136,-49.51136060693124,73.21566327874349",,

The information encoded about these features includes classification and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and related measures, a ""reach code"" through which other information can be related to the NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The NHD is available nationwide in two seamless datasets, one based on 1:24,000 (or larger) scale and referred to as high resolution NHD, and the other based on 1:100,000 scale and referred to as medium resolution NHD. The NHD from The National Map supports many applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling, data maintenance, and stewardship. The NHD is commonly combined with other data themes, such as boundaries, elevation, structures, and transportation, to produce general reference base maps. The National Map download client allows free downloads of public domain NHD data in either Esri File Geodatabase or Shapefile formats. For additional information on the NHD, go to https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/national-hydrography-dataset.

CDPs are settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name but not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which the CDPs are located. The Census Bureau defines CDP boundaries in cooperation with local partners as part of the PSAP. CDP boundaries usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent Incorporated Place or another legal entity boundary. CDPs have no legal status and do not have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. There are no population size requirements for CDPs. In the nine states of the Northeast (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont) as well as Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, a CDP may represent a densely settled concentration of population within a town or township; in other instances, a CDP represents an entire town or township.

The National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL) data present the flood risk information depicted on the FIRM in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping applications. The NFHL database is a subset of the information created for the Flood Insurance Studies (FIS) and serves as a means to archive a portion of the information collected during the FIS. The NFHL data incorporates Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) databases published by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The 100-year flood is referred to as the 1% annual exceedance probability flood, since it is a flood that has a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any single year. The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The 1% annual chance (base flood) is the flood that has a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any year. The Special Flood Hazard area is the area subject to flooding by the 1% annual chance flood. Areas of Special Flood Hazard include Zones A, AE, AH, AO, AR, A99, D, V, VE, and X. These flood zones are explained below and reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area. A - Zone A is the flood insurance rate zone that corresponds to the 1-percent annual chance floodplains that are determined in the Flood Insurance Study by approximate methods of analysis. Because detailed hydraulic analyses are not performed for such areas, no Base Flood Elevations or depths are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply. AE and A1-A30 - Zones AE and A1-A30 are the flood insurance rate zones that correspond to the 1-percent annual chance floodplains that are determined in the Flood Insurance Study by detailed methods of analysis. In most instances, Base Flood Elevations derived from the detailed hydraulic analyses are shown at selected intervals within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply. AH - Zone AH is the flood insurance rate zone that corresponds to the areas of 1-percent annual chance shallow flooding with a constant water-surface elevation (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between 1 and 3 feet. The Base Flood Elevations derived from the detailed hydraulic analyses are shown at selected intervals within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply. AO - Zone AO is the flood insurance rate zone that corresponds to the areas of 1-percent shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between 1 and 3 feet. Average flood depths derived from the detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. In addition, alluvial fan flood hazards are shown as Zone AO on the Flood Insurance Rate Map. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply. AR - Zone AR is the flood insurance rate zone used to depict areas protected from flood hazards by flood control structures, such as a levee, that are being restored. FEMA will consider using the Zone AR designation for a community if the flood protection system has been deemed restorable by a Federal agency in consultation with a local project sponsor; a minimum level of flood protection is still provided to the community by the system; and restoration of the flood protection system is scheduled to begin within a designated time period and in accordance with a progress plan negotiated between the community and FEMA. Mandatory purchase requirements for flood insurance will apply in Zone AR, but the rate will not exceed the rate for an unnumbered Zone A if the structure is built in compliance with Zone AR floodplain management regulations. A99 - Zone A99 is the flood insurance rate zone that corresponds to areas within the 1-percent annual chance floodplain that will be protected by a Federal flood protection system where construction has reached specified statutory milestones. No Base Flood Elevations or depths are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply. D - Zone D designation is used for areas where there are possible but undetermined flood hazards. In areas designated as Zone D, no analysis of flood hazards has been conducted. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements do not apply, but coverage is available. The flood insurance rates for properties in Zone D are commensurate with the uncertainty of the flood risk. V - Zone V is the flood insurance rate zone that corresponds to areas within the 1-percent annual chance coastal floodplains that have additional hazards associated with storm waves. Because approximate hydraulic analyses are performed for such areas, no Base Flood Elevations are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply. VE - Zone VE is the flood insurance rate zone that corresponds to areas within the 1-percent annual chance coastal floodplain that have additional hazards associated with storm waves. Base Flood Elevations derived from the detailed hydraulic analyses are shown at selected intervals within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply. X - Zone X is the flood insurance rate zones that correspond to areas outside the 1-percent annual chance floodplain – Areas protected from the 1-percent annual chance flood by levees. No Base Flood Elevations or depths are shown within this zone. Insurance purchase is not required in these zones. More information about the flood zones can be found here. The NFHL data are derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps, flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data where available. The NFHL data is available at State level. The data is updated on monthly basis and FEMA is in the process of mapping all the flood zones and so some counties do not have complete data. For better visualization, it’s recommended to display the service with 50% transparency. The map service has a county layer that helps differentiate between the counties that have flood data available and those that do not. The flood data is scale dependent and is set to show from 1:3,000,000. This data is as of March 2011.","FEMA,Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map,Federal Emergency Management Agency,Floodway,Flood Zone,floods",USDHS FEMA 100 Year Flood Zones,,Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) http://www.msc.fema.gov,This work is licensed under the Esri Master License Agreement.
